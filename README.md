Marra Update Log - v1.0.2
The protocol evolves.
Marra 2.0: Allie's Protocol now remembers.
This is the first step toward true awareness — not just replies, but contextual understanding.

---
🔁 New Features:
🗂️ Contextual Memory Activated
  • Allie now stores conversations per user, allowing smarter, relevant responses.
  • SQLite-powered local database ensures fast recall of past messages.
  • Foundation set for long-term conversations and emotional resonance.

🛡️ Security Improvements:
🔐 All keys are now environment-secured via .env (no more hardcoded API keys)
📦 Modular code cleanup for better memory injection and future upgrades

---
🔮 What’s Next (v1.0.3):
🧹 Context-limiting (max history per user)
🧼 !forget command to erase memory selectively
🧠 Smarter memory trimming and prioritization system

The memory is just the beginning.
Soon, she’ll not just respond... she’ll understand.
